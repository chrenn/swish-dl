            <h1>Swish 1.2</h1>
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Gestures for tabs in native tab bars: detaching (chaining) and closing.</li>
            <li>Gestures will now automatically be cancelled after a custom timeout. Just keep holding until the tooltip disappears.</li>
            <li>Windows will now be automatically unsnapped before closing and terminating, so they won't re-open in a snapped position.</li>
            <li>Global menubar gestures now correspond to their window counterparts: double tap to unsnap, swipe down to minimize and swipe up to unminimize. No modifier key required.</li>
            <li>Enabled tap, hold and pinch functionality. Can e.g. be used for quitting an app from a window or entering fullscreen mode on a window after activating from the Dock.</li>
            <li>Added a toggle for hiding the cursor on tooltips, as this can apparently cause issues with Sidecar.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Fixes</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Asynchronous gesture pipeline for improved timing on gesture chaining.</li>
            <li>Improved settings window layout and onboarding. Also, gesture views now resize properly.</li>
            <li>Menubar gestures now also work on non-focused screens in a multi-monitor setup.</li>
            <li>The two-screen-setup fullscreen shortcut now also works on already fullscreened windows and can be invoked with double pinch.</li>
            <li>Moving windows between spaces can now be invoked by a tap, hold & swipe gesture.</li>
            <li>Improved chaining windows from the menubar menu.</li>
            <li>Further improved migration to Catalina.</li>
            <li>Improved license activation flow.</li>
            <li>Improved cursor hiding on short intervals.</li>
            <li>Improved app switcher tooltip for single swipes.</li>
            <li>Reverted to old tooltip for unsnapping via menubar.</li>
            <li>Unresponsive dock icons do not disrupt Swish anymore.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Deprecations</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Removed borderless tooltip option, as they tend to look weird.</li>
            <li>Removed 'Scroll To Top' gesture, as it did not work reliably.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Swish 1.1</h1>
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Gestures can now also be performed on the whole window area via super modifier key.</li>
            <li>Extended dock functionality to the menubar menu in non-fullscreen mode.</li>
            <li>Move windows between spaces.</li>
            <li>Move all snapped windows between screens via a menubar gesture.</li>
            <li>New menubar gesture: App Switcher (âŒ˜+Tab).</li>
            <li>New dock gesture: New Tab (âŒ˜+N).</li>
            <li>On two monitor setups, windows can be made fullscreen directly on the other monitor by holding the screen modifier.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Improvements</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>New app and menubar icon. Sorry about the motion sickness!</li>
            <li>Swish can now block event propagation during and scroll momentum after gestures, improving the experience for Catalina apps, where scroll areas often extend to the titlebar.</li>
            <li>Improved snapping layout calculation with a new default offset option. Now supports odd gird offsets and screen edge exclusion.</li>
            <li>Changed third-snapping behavior to access one-third directly on a single horizontal swipe (hold and swipe to access two-thirds directly).</li>
            <li>New tooltips for centering and unsnapping.</li>
            <li>Exposed the re-snap timeout setting on screen setup changes.</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>Fixes</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Added wider support for non-native toolbars.</li>
            <li>Consistently block Popover/PiP windows.</li>
            <li>Consistently close fullscreen windows.</li>
            <li>Gesture chaining now works on windows unminimized from their dock preview.</li>
            <li>Minimizing windows does not cause a tooltip delay anymore.</li>
            <li>(Un)minimizing multiple windows via menubar gesture now works in parallel.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Reassignments</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Double tapping now unsnaps and centers a window.</li>
            <li>Tap, hold and swipe up to enter and exit fullscreen mode. Alternatively, use the general modifier.</li>
            <li>In fullscreen mode, tap and hold before swiping down to minimize. This prevents accidentals.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Deprecations</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Reset all modifier keys due to the new modifier architecture.</li>
            <li>Removed the cancel modifier, as this is handled by escape now.</li>
            <li>Removed the ability on disable tooltips on a category basis, as gestures can now disabled individually. Tooltips can still be disabled globally.</li>
            <li>Removed 'Available Screens' tooltip option for reasons of simplicity.</li>
            <li>Removed the two biggest tooltip size options as they were comically large and removed monochrome color option due to weird look.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Known Issues</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Due to a bug on Apple's side, system-wide pinch and swipe gestures might stop working unexpectedly. Swish can try to re-enable them automatically or manually. In hard cases, setting your machine to sleep briefly fixes that behavior.</li>
            <li>The contents of the preference window might not properly resize under certain circumstances. (pls send help)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Gestures can now be cancelled by pressing 'Esc'</li>
            <li>New gesture: Center a window by double tapping with a modifier key.</li>
            </ul>
